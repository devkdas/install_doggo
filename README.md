# Doggo Installer

This repository contains the installer script for [doggo](https://github.com/mr-karan/doggo), a command-line DNS client.

The `install.sh` script in this repository is automatically kept up-to-date with the latest version from the official `doggo` repository. A GitHub Actions workflow runs daily to check for changes and updates the script if necessary.
